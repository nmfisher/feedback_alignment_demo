# Feedback Alignment Demo

This repository contains a hand-rolled neural network/back-prop implementation. The purpose is to demonstrate that feedback alignment can be used to train the network to learn XOR - i.e. learning without using the forward weights during back-propagation.

It was also a useful exercise to implement back-propagation in F#!
